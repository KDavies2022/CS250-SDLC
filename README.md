How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

This is done by looking over what exactly the user is wanting and  breaking the request down to it's most bare bones reduction. A lot of the time users will have information that although might be helpful most of the time is just information that needs filtered out. User Stories help this by allowing the Product Owner the chance to look over all the information provided and creating a story on what the user wants to be able to do and how they want to do it, this allows the development team to focus on the important needs of the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs from a single developer point of view. I usually plan out what I want to accomplish followed by a pseudocode or flowchart on how the main methods or functions will work before I start coding the project. With what I've learned I hope to take some more flexible agile processes into my developement style so I can work more efficiently instead of getting hung up on making sure the entire program works from the get go, maybe doing more of a sprint style rotational focus on specific methods and features first.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development means being open to communication, both listening and talking. Teams are built on how well people can work with each other to get the specific tasks they've taken on resolved. Ultimately I think communication is the largest and most important part of working on a team. You need to be able to point out issues you're having and be comfortable to reach out and ask for help with them as well as being confident enough to help others when they finally reach out asking for help.
